-- Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the
-- thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and
-- drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery
-- parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the
-- parking lot in that time frame.

---- Transscript of the interview of Eugene:
-- I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I
-- recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at
-- Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street
-- and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

---- Transscript of the interview of Raymond:
-- As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called
-- someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
-- In the call, I heard the thief say that they were
-- planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville
-- tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other
-- end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
